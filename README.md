# My Karabiner Elements config from a long time ago

Probably best to pass this one by, but I used it about 5 years ago in [Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) to accomplish a few things for my old Touch Bar MacBook Pro:

* Convert the grave key to Esc (to give me back a physical Esc key)
* Add Fn + a number to the corresponding F-key (e.g. Fn+1 = F1, Fn+2 = F2, etc.)

Now that I don't use a Touch Bar MacBook Pro anymore, I haven't used Karabiner Elements in a few years. Karabiner has been updated several times since I last used this, so I can't guarantee all of this even works anymore.
